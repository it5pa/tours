            <p><em>tours detours</em> is a creative travel agency sometimes composed of and not limited to Gréta Þorkels, Alejandro Bellón Ample, Louise Borinski and Paula Buškevica. Together they produce pamphlets of sought out knowledge and aim to form groups of travel-bodies to explore the world as we find it.
             They seek to be in the present, but also can't help looking back at the past (it is what made us) and dreaming into the future as the mind is unstoppable.</p>
             <p><em>tours detours</em> is like time travel but in the present.</p>
